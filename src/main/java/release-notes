version 0.5.6
- changed OPC UA namespace tree to mimic the OPC UA server we are currently testing (hardcoded => change needed to make this smart)

version 0.5.7

- introduced '-port' commandline argument to be able to set the port the service runs on

- introduced the '-namespace' argument to be able to set the namespace of the data OPC UA player serves
- introduced the '-url' argument to be able to set the main url the OPC UA Player serves
- introduced the '-servicename' argument to be able to set the name of the OPC UA Player
- check for example with java -jar OPCUA-Controllable-Player-0.5.8-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -autostart -port 4840 -servicename TTI_WST_OPCUA_B -uri / -namespace http://www.siemens.com/simatic-classic-s7-opcua -datafile PlayerDemoData.csv -configfile AssetConfiguration.csv

version 0.5.9
- bugfix of endless loop mode : time shift to current time was not recalculated at the end of the loop (used UA Expert datalogger feature to verify if bug was fixed)

version 0.5.10
- merged into 0.5.5 master

version 0.5.11
- refactored processing of config file, it now accepts dotted asset names so that these become folders under root/object and the names of the folders and variable nodes will have the full dotted name
- this was changed in reading the config file, in the namespace construction and processing of the data file
